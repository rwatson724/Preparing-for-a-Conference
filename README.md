# Preparing-for-a-Conference

Whether you are a first-time conference attendee or an experienced conference attendee, this paper can help you in getting the most out of your conference experience. As long-standing conference attendees and volunteers, we have found that there are some things that people just donâ€™t think about when planning their conference attendance. In this paper we will discuss helpful tips such as making the appropriate travel arrangements for in-person and hybrid conferences, setting up your home office space for a virtual conference, what to bring and/or have on hand, networking and meeting up with friends and colleagues both in person and virtually, and how to prepare for your role at the conference, whatever the format. We will also discuss maintaining a workplace presence with your paying job while present in any form at the conference.

Louise Hadden and I wrote a paper as well as recorded a presentation to help you prepare for a conference.
